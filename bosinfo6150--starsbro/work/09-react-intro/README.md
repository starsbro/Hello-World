# React Intro Assignment

**Due Wed Mar 20, 11:59pm ET**

## Goal

Create a react project that:
- Has a component with state that is modified
- Conditionally displays another component
- This other component uses a callback to modify the ancestors state
- Uses CSS on elements in a component
- Uses a CSS animation to show a fade-in effect


## Setup Requirements

- Create a react project named "inventory" using Vite **inside this directory**
- Modify the files in the src/ directory inside inventory/ to meet the requirements
- For css, you can add/modify as many css files as you want in /src, including src/index.css that is also applied to the output.
- Remember to meet the initial changes required in class:
    - Use semicolons
    - Remove any default content that you aren't deliberately using for your assignment
- You will need to create a Reorder.jsx for the Reorder Component
- The Reorder component should only accept one prop, "onReorder", which should be a function that takes no arguments.  When called, it will set the count to 5.
  - This is a common point of confusion!  
  - Your App component will manage the state of the inventory (the count)
  - Your App component will CONDITIONALLY show the Reorder component to display the "Reorder" button
  - When clicked, the Reorder button in the Reorder component will call the function passed as "onReorder" to change the inventory state stored in App

## Functional Requirements

Your App component:
- Displays a count for an inventory
  - Hint: This will be a state in the App Component
- Allows you to increase/decrease the displayed count using +/- buttons
- Offers a "Reorder" button when the count is 0
  - Implement this in a Reorder component that is only shown when the count is 0
    - Hint: This means the Reorder Component is conditionally rendered inside App Component
  - Clicking the Reorder button will add 5 to the count
- Does not allow you to decrease the count below 0
  - Hint: put a `disabled={!count}` prop on the decrease button.  This will disable the button when the count is 0.
- Pressing the Reorder button sets the inventory count to 5
  - Hint: The Reorder button will need to change state that is defined in the App component.  This means you will need to pass a function to the Reorder component. Per the Setup Requirements, the passed "onReorder" prop is a function that takes no arguments, so App.jsx will have to define a function that does the state change and pass that function as "onReorder" to the Reorder component.

## Visual Requirements
- The buttons should have some space between them and each other as well as the output text
- the inventory count, the +/- buttons, and the Reorder button should all appear on the same line
- The Reorder button is ONLY shown when the Count is 0
- When it appears, the reorder button will have a "fade in" animation
  - Hint: set a CSS animation on the element or a wrapper of the element to animate from opacity 0 to opacity 1.  Use a CSS animation (with keyframes) instead of a CSS transition.

## Restrictions

- Do not use table, CSS table-cell, floats, or other related concepts for layout
- Do not use outside JS or CSS libraries (including any outside React libraries, which are JS libraries).  Only use Vite as shown in class.
- Follow the methods used in class or described in this README

## Submission Instructions

* start from the up-to-date main branch (`git checkout main; git pull origin main`)
* Create a feature branch named 'react-intro' (`git checkout -b react-intro`)
* add the necessary files in this directory to have the required features
* add, commit, and push the branch to github
  - You will merge ALL the files created by Vite, not just the files you personally modify
  - Except for `node_modules/` and `dist/` (which should automatically be ignored by the .gitignore file Vite creates) you want to commit all the files Vite creates so that anyone getting your project from github can use it without making changes.
* Create a PR to merge to main
* Be sure to include the TA(s) and myself reviewer(s)
